# Skating Polly Official Website

This is the official website for Skating Polly — a band I co-founded and co-manage. I designed, coded, and continue to maintain this site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project reflects my ongoing development as a creative technologist, with a focus on accessible design, fan engagement, and custom digital experiences.
